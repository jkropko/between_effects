Using pooled time-series cross-section data on election results from 15 East European democracies, the empirical analysis finds that (1) right after a regime change electoral volatility increases while the trend is reversed after democracy has endured for about a decade; (2) ethnic cleavages have no effect on stability while social cleavages affect electoral stability only during economic downturns; (3) both institutions and economic performance influence the stability of party support; however, the effect of the latter diminishes over time when democracies mature."

Our analyses of network coverage of U.S. senators during the 1970s and 1980s find that the networks follow objective routines, which normally ensure balanced reporting of political affairs. During times of seismic change in the political landscape, however, these very routines can produce what might be interpreted as biased coverage. The first four years of the Reagan administration, we show, is a striking example of this phenomenon. We label this the ""paradox of objectivity,"" a phenomenon that greatly complicates the evaluation of news reporting."

Past research shows that many people vote to conform with the social norm that voting is a civic duty. The hypothesis here is that when conformity motivates people to vote, it also stimulates conformist behavior among some voters when they decide which party to vote for. This produces a distinctive relationship between voter turnout and the distribution of votes among parties—a relationship not anticipated by rational choice theory. I test a mathematical model of this behavior with linear and nonlinear regression analyses of state-level data for presidential elections in the United States from 1904 to 1996, longitudinal data on parliamentary elections in Western Europe over most of the twentieth century, and cross-sectional data for recent elections in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Russia. The results generally validate the model."

This analysis argues that a fundamental conceptual issue with how democratization is studied is responsible for their findings. Namely, economic development has the opposite effect on the onset and outcome of institutional change. In an analysis of 178 countries from 1816 to 2004, this study finds that economic development decreases the probability of major institutional change, but increases the probability that such a change will be towards democracy. This finding is remarkably robust to the inclusion of control variables and fixed-effects estimation."

Voting records of southern Democrats elected prior to 1982 remained relatively constant, and we find no evidence of any general trend in the recent voting patterns of southern Democrats when controlling for other factors."

Using data from 1971 to 1999, I analyze several hypotheses about how party affects women's recruitment to the lower houses of state legislatures. I argue that the incentive structure facing potential women candidates is somewhat different for Democratic and Republican women. The social eligibility pool, legislative professionalism, and partisan composition of the legislature affect women's representation differently by party. Rather than assuming a single path for women to elective office, this research implies that it is necessary to disaggregate women by party in order to understand the pattern of where women run for and hold state legislative office."

I investigate institutionalization's effects on the vulnerability of state elections to major periodic forces--coattails, turnout, and economic conditions--and how political responsibility for economic growth is apportioned between presidents and governors in state elections. The investigation relies upon dynamic models of state legislative and gubernatorial outcomes estimated with a pooled data set comprised of most states and electionsin the years 1940-82. The results, which have important implications for state government more broadly, indicate that institutionalization has substantially insulated legislative elections against major threats and that state legislators and governors have less to fear from their state economies than is often thought, but also that state elections are becoming more susceptible to swings in the national economy."

Rhetoric aside, human rights considerations did play a role in determining whether or not a state received military aid during the Reagan and Bush administrations, but not for the Carter or Clinton administration. With the exception of the Clinton administration, human rights was a determinant factor in the decision to grant economic aid, albeit of secondary importance. To the question ""Does a state's human rights record affect the amount of U.S. bilateral aid it receives?"" we answer yes for economic aid, but no for military aid. Human rights considerations are neither the only nor the primary consideration in aid allocation."

A pooled cross-sectional time-series regression analysis is conducted on 58 congressional elections and 43 presidential elections in 16 Latin American countries during the 1980s and 1990s. Institutional variables have the most consistent effect on volatility, while the influence of economic performance is heavily contingent upon the type of election and whether the dependent variable is operationalized as incumbent vote change or aggregate electoral volatility. The results demonstrate that electoral volatility is a function of short-term economic perturbations, the institutional fragilities of both democratic regimes and party systems, and relatively fluid cleavage structures."

Power theory views relationships between groups as a function of their competitive positions in political, economic, and social arenas. In contexts where the threat posed by a minority group is high, the dominant group's response is predicted to be more hostile than in contexts where that threat is low. A pooled time series analysis of voter registration data for Louisiana parishes for 1975-90 provides support for the operation of the threat mechanism. Higher black concentrations are associated with declines in the percentage of white registered voters who are Democrats and an increase in the percentage who are Republicans. Consistent with the expectations of power theory, this relationship is conditioned by the social status of the parish."

Previous studies of this hypothesis rely on presidential and House elections or on survey data, but senatorial and gubernatorial elections offer better conditions for directly testing turnout effects in U.S. politics. In a comprehensive analysis of these statewide elections since 1928, we find that the conventional theory was true outside the South through 1964, but since 1965 the overall relationship between turnout and partisan outcomes has been insignificant. Even before the mid-1960s, the turnout effect outside the South was strongest in Republican states and insignificant or negative in heavily Democratic states. A similar but weaker pattern obtains after 1964. In the South, which we analyze only since 1966, higher turnout helped Republicans until 1990, but in 1990-94 the effect became pro-Democratic. The conventional theory cannot account for these complex patterns, but they are impressively consistent with DeNardo's (1980) theory."

A significant component of the increase is the deterioration of Republican fortunes in state legislatures: after the 1990 and 1992 elections, for example, only five state legislatures were controlled by the Republicans. I shall examine the hypothesis that the professionalization of state legislatures makes legislative service more attractive to Democratic candidates and less attractive to Republican candidates, because full-time legislative service is incompatible with another career, and Democrats, on average, have less lucrative career opportunities than Republicans. Statistical analysis of post-World War II legislative elections outside the South is consistent with the argument: other things being equal, every ten-thousand-dollar increase in real biennial legislative compensation is associated with approximately a 1% increase in Democratic legislators."

In the United States, Congress is the institution in which most of the key allocating decisions are made. To the extent the U.S. political system is integrated, the coalitions that form around the issues debated in Congress should be reflected in the coalitions that support presidential candidates and those that support the major political parties. We formulate a spatial theory of political change in which new ideological cleavages appear in congressional behavior and presidential elections and gradually reorganize the mass party base. The theory leads us explicitly to consider the question of dealignment and to specify conditions under which the parties will lose support from voters."

Over the past several decades many proponents of eased voter registration requirements have predicted that liberalizing voter registration laws will significantly improve turnout, especially among the least well-educated and the poor. In this article we offer a rational choice model of turnout that leads us to expect the greatest turnout gains from virtually eliminating voter registration costs will instead accrue to those with medium income and education. We test this prediction longitudinally over the period 1972-1992 using a vast survey and a natural experiment comparing voters in states that adopted election day registration (EDR) with those residing in states maintaining more traditional closing dates. Contrary to much of the literature, citizens with medium education and medium income voted more under EDR, as the model predicts. We conclude that the methods used here better capture and empirically identify the curvilinear relationship between voter registration laws and the turnout probabilities at various SES levels."

Constituent trust is defined as the level of confidence that constituents have in their elected representative. Thisanalysis suggests a strategy for measuring constituent trust and develops a model that relates constituent trust directly and indirectly to electoral support. By pooling cross-sectional data drawn from the University of Michigan'sAmerican National Election Studies (1978-84), I demonstrate that when constituent trust is salient in voter cognitions, it has a significant direct influence on electoral support and is a better predictor of electoral support than the incumbent's party identification. In addition to its direct effects, I show that constituent trust indirectly influences electoral support because of its casual relationship to incumbent popularity."

In fact, becoming a party to this covenant seems to be concomitant with joining the UN. Of the newly independent states in Eastern Europe and in the region of the former Soviet Union, only Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Moldova, and Macedonia have not joined the treaty. This article tests empirically whether becoming a party to this international treaty (and its optional protocol) has an observable impact on the state party's actual behavior. The hypothesis is tested across 178 countries over an eighteen-year period (1976-93) and across four different measures of state human rights behavior. Initial bivariate analyses demonstrate some statistically significant differences between the behavior of states parties and the behavior of non-party states. However, this difference does not appear in the bivariate analysis that compares the states parties' behavior before becoming a party to the treaty with their behavior after becoming a party state. When the analysis progresses to more sophisticated multivariate analysis, in which factors known to affect human rights are controlled, the impact of the covenant and its optional protocol disappears altogether. Overall, this study suggests that it may be overly optimistic to expect that being a party to this international covenant will produce an observable direct impact."

We use a comparative statics research design to examine eight congresses with large numbers of new members that were also characterized by different national forces. Multivariate OLS models of party support are used to isolate the effects of first-term status while controlling for other factors that might influence a member's willingness to support his or her party. We find that national forces have the expected general effect on the partisan support of new members of the advantaged party, and that the size of that effect varies with the particular character of the national forces."

Economic aspects of globalization can bring new opportunities and resources to women. But equally important, globalization promotes the diffusion of ideas and norms of equality for women. In an analysis of 180 countries from 1975 to 2000, employing cross-sectional-time-series regression techniques, we examine the impact of several measures of globalization on women's levels of life expectancy, literacy, and participation in the economy and parliamentary office. International trade, foreign direct investment, membership in the United Nations (UN) and World Bank, and ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), are associated with improved conditions for women."

This research focuses on different types of regime change that vary in direction and intensity. It tests the effect of political regime changes on life integrity violations at time t and at time t - 1. The results show that regime change in general does not alter the levels of repression. However, change from autocracy toward democracy decreases repression during the transition period, whereas change from democracy to anocracy increases life integrity violations. It is also shown that the higher the magnitude of democratization, the less state violence occurs during the year of the change, once relevant control variables are considered."

Two dimensions of democracy loosely based on Dahl's Polyarchy - average democracy over time and the lowest level of democracy during a multi-year period of time - are regressed against two indicators of militarization, military spending and military participation ratios. In pooled time-series analyses, it is shown that: (a) military spending has a significant negative effect on democracy scores over time; and (b) that military participation ratios have a more robust negative impact. In an alternative cross-sectional design and holding the lagged level of democracy constant, both militarization indicators are strongly related to low levels of democracy during a multi-year time period. When the two indicators are simultaneously utilized as regressors, military participation ratio remains robust and military spending becomes trivial. It is suggested that military participation ratios have a much stronger negative effect on democracy because (a) the data are more reliable for participation than expenditures, and (b) military participation ratio includes a pro-authoritarian socializing dimension. No evidence exists to support reversed causality: High militarization causes low levels of democracy, low levels of democracy do not cause militarization. Finally, it is shown that the negative impact of militarization on democracy began to diminish in the late 1970s, such that the negative effect is much stronger in 1973-74 than in 1985-86."

While aggregate level studies find a strong relationship between the state of the economy and the congressional vote, individual level studies performed in the latter half of the postwar era find little or no relationship between personal economic conditions and vote choice. It is argued that this lack of congruence exists because the impact of short-term economic fluctuations on voting in congressional elections has decreased dramatically over time. Using aggregate data, the relationship between economic changes and voting patterns is found to be time dependent; economic conditions are no longer major determinants of House elections. An examination of Senate elections indicates that this trend is limited to the House, in that economic fluctuations continue to influence senatorial contests. This House-Senate difference, it is proposed, stems from the different electoral dynamics of the two chambers."

We hypothesize that there are two different paths to desirable macroeconomic performance. In countries with densely and centrally organized labor movements, leftist governments can promote economic growth and reduce inflation and unemployment. Conversely, in countries with weak labor movements, rightist governments can pursue their partisan-preferred macroeconomic strategies and achieve similarly beneficial macroeconomic outcomes. Performance will be poorer in other cases. These hypotheses are supported by analysis of pooled annual time series data for 16 advanced industrial democracies between 1967 and 1984."

Indeed, based on the assumption that a coercive military response is required if security is to be preserved, arms are widely viewed as an instrument of defense from external threat.

This article endeavors to expand upon both our understanding of arms as a source of conflict and our knowledge of the correlates of human rights repression. To this end, this study tests the relationship between the importation of arms and the repression of personal integrity rights. Employing a pooled time-series cross-sectional design, the patterns of arms acquisitions behavior and human rights violations are examined for developing countries for the years 1982 through 1992. The results indicate that arms imports by developing countries are linked to poor human rights conditions. Thus, arms acquisitions appear to contribute to repression by making violent political acts more feasible."

We then examine the effect of the EC legal system on policy outcomes at both the national and supranational levels in two policy domains: the free movement of goods and gender equality. Our theory outperforms its leading rival, intergovernmentalism. The evidence shows that European integration has generally been driven by transnational activity and the efforts of EC institutions to reduce transaction costs, behavior which governments react to but do not control."

Because of a two-year time lag, however, it is difficult to make a theoretical link between the aggregate defense budget and domestic politics. We focus on defense contract awards because of their rapid turn-around. We advance the referendum model to account for variations in the timing of defense contracts within administrations. The referendum model posits that government policies are reflective of approval ratings and that the President uses defense contracts to counter sagging approval and/or a weak economy. This is a subtle but important alternative to political business cycle (PBC) models which constrain political manipulation of the defense budget to the electoral cycle. An empirical model is tested using pooled time-series analysis which allows us to assess variation within administrations. The analysis reveals that presidential approval, war, presidential reelection, and unemployment are determinants of defense contracting."

Next, using data from all 50 states for the biennial periods from 1978 to 1991, we test a multivariate probabilistic model of determining whether a most effective governor is currently in office. The logistic regression results indicate that gubernatorial effectiveness in office is associated with the presence of a highly professionalized state legislature, relatively high state economic growth, and joint increases in gubernatorial institutional powers and enabling resources. This suggests that both institutional and environmental considerations influence gubernatorial effectiveness in office and that the power relationship between the governor and the state legislature is not necessarily a zero-sum game, with one institution gaining influence at the expense of the other."

We theorize that two aspects of the relations between nations should predict enhanced trade levels: similarity in political system and similarity in foreign policy orientation. We test this proposition for U.S. exports to 76 importing nations over an 18-year period in a pooled time-series design that controls for known influences on trade flows. Our results suggest that these two political factors have a substantial and predictable impact on U.S. export patterns. We consider some possible criticisms of our results along with some suggestions for future research."

This study employs a pooling of National Election Studies survey data, 1956-84, augmented by a time series of national economic statistics to evaluate ""sociotropic"" and ""pocketbook"" conceptions of voting and to assess the advantage of incumbency in presidential elections. Personal financial predicaments are found to carry weight in individuals' voting decisions, but changing macroeconomic conditions are more important as determinants of election outcomes. Also, the degree to which incumbency is an electoral asset depends upon election-year economic circumstances. Although it was not designed for such purposes, the model presented here generally forecast presidential election outcomes well, even though it ignored the personalities and issues of the campaigns. That result provokes some thoughts about the impact of campaign events and strategies on presidential contests."

The analysis shows robust support for the empirical relationship between income inequality and personal integrity rights abuse across the whole sample of countries as well as for distinct subsets, including non-communist countries and non-OECD countries. The hypothesized effect of land inequality is also born out by the data, although its effects are less substantial and less robust across different methods of estimation. Additional variables with explanatory weight include the level of income, democracy, ethnic fragmentation, domestic conflict, and population size. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the results are not due to reverse causation, misspecification or omitted variable bias. The analysis is discussed in the context of inequality and rights abuse in specific country cases and the policy implications of the results are considered in the conclusion."

The results indicate that, even controlling for a wide range of religious, sociodemographic, and political variables, the influence of doctrinal conservatism on partisanship andpresidential vote choice is growing over time. The relationship beween the orthodoxy of Protestant denominations and political behavior also has changed considerably, with members of evangelical denominations becoming increasingly Republican relative to their counterparts in mainline denominations. The impact of religious commitment on presidential vote choice also is growing, with very committed individuals becoming increasingly more likely than their less religious counterparts to vote Republican. The analysis demonstrates that the political differences between religious ""conservatives"" and religious ""liberals""are beginning to rival those between Christians and Jews and Catholics and Protestants."

Using pooled cross-sectional data from 1940 to 1992, I test the importance of the state legislative context within which strategic politicians make their decision to run. Democrats' decision are shaped by the funding opportunities offered to them in professionalized state legislatures; Republican decisions are shaped by the opportunities presented by the state legislature for power and influence relative to those offered by minority status in the House. Professionalized state legislatures have also had more of an impact on the quality of the Democratic party's candidate pool for Congress than they have for the Republican's."

Excessive focus on the personalization or institutionalization of authoritarian regimes' decision-making procedures has distracted attention from the more critical issue of what institutions these regimes deploy to enhance social control and secure political incumbency. Since military regimes are systematically less effective than single-party regimes at developing these types of authoritarian institutions, they more frequently resort to desperate measures to fend off domestic challenges to their power. In particular, we find compelling empirical support for our hypothesis that military regimes are more likely than single-party regimes to initiate military disputes, irrespective of whether those regimes are highly personalized or not."

Pooled time series analyses of welfare effort in 18 nations during the 1960-82 period show that electoral turnout, as well as left and center governments increase welfare effort; that the welfare efforts of governments led by particular types of parties show significant differences and vary notably with the strength of oppositional (and junior coalitional) parties; and that relatively neocorporatist, centralized, and traditionalistic polities are high on welfare effort.

Employing data on 151 countries from 1977 to 2004, this study also investigates whether there has been an increase in the impact of human rights practices since the end of the Cold War. The results of the analysis show that during the Cold War, economic development was the prevailing factor in decisions about whether to allocate US aid. In the post-Cold War era, human rights practices are one among several significant variables, albeit exerting a generally negative impact. These results indicate that shifts in the international environment have, in fact, altered the determinants of US foreign aid. The authors further demonstrate that after the Cold War, countries with low economic development and transitioning regimes are subject to diminished levels of accountability for their human rights practices, while aid allocations to autocratic regimes follow the logic of promoting relatively higher human rights standards."

Individual judicial votes on death penalty cases from 1980 through 1988 in six state supreme courts are examined employing pooled PROBIT analysis. The results indicate that justices' decisions to dissent reflect significantly more than mere attitudinal disagreement, reactions to various types of case facts or responses to contextual forces. Rather, dissents are the product of all of these types of variables interacting with institutional rules and arrangements. As neo-institutionalism suggests, institutional arrangements serve to condition the effects of personal attributes, case characteristics and contextual variables on judicial choice and as such are critical determinants of the judicial vote."

Here we find statistical evidence that military regimes lead to somewhat greater human rights abuse, defined in terms of violations of personal integrity, once democracy and a host of other factors are controlled. Further, we find that countries that have experienced British colonial influence tend to have relatively fewer abuses of personal integrity rights than others. Finally, our results suggest that leftist countries are actually less repressive of these basic human rights than non-leftist countries. Consistent with the Poe and Tate (1994) study, however, we find that past levels of repression, democracy, population size, economic development, and international and civil wars exercise statistically significant and substantively important impacts on personal integrity abuse."

Furthermore, the likelihood that women win these elections is influenced by the supply of candidates, the demands of gatekeepers, and the characteristics of a state's political system. We also conclude that the predictors of women in executive office have changed over time and that our explanations for state variation of women in these positions are more thorough for elections occurring before 1991."

In particular, prominent arguments are considered about the primacy of regime security concerns and the dynamics of warlord politics in the foreign policymaking of African states, the economic incentives of peacekeeping, and the importance of African states' concerns over their state legitimacy and territorial integrity. First, this study investigates the possibility that peacekeeping might be utilized as a diversionary strategy to divert the attention of both an African state's military and major powers from a regime's misrule. Second, this study examines the extent to which financial and material assistance from donor states encourages poorer states to engage in peacekeeping. Third, the study investigates whether states with less legitimate and more arbitrary borders might have greater incentive to contribute to peacekeeping operations to promote the territorial status quo in Africa. Empirical evidence from a quantitative analysis across 47 states of sub-Saharan Africa from 1989 to 2001 suggests that states that are poorer, with lower state legitimacy and lower political repression, participate more often in regional peacekeeping."

From this perspective, dissent, or the tendency to form less than unanimous voting coalitions, is viewed not merely as the collective expression of individual attitudes or policy preferences or the result of structural characteristics of institutions but rather as a complex interaction of values and structures. A model incorporating variables derived from the neo-institutional perspective was estimated with GLS-ARMA and compared to an environmental model generated from past research. The amount of variation in dissent rates uniquely accounted for by the neo-institutional model is over six times that of the environmental model, while a composite model can explain more than one-third of the variation in state supreme court dissent rates for 1966, 1973, and 1981. More importantly, however, all the relationships posited by the neo-institutional approach are statistically significant and in the expected direction. An institutional approach guided by rational choice theory offers an important contribution toward developing a more refined understanding of judicial behavior."

The theory states that organized issue constituents and the larger voting public, respectively, make private (i.e., advocacy) and collective (i.e., certainty) demands for policy benefits supplied by committees. I hypothesize that the levels of these competing demands drive two activities changing committee jurisdiction concentrations: ""nonlegislative"" and ""legislative"" jurisdiction advances. To test my hypotheses, I use nonlegislative committee hearings and bill referrals over a 15-year period (1979-93) to construct annual, issue-specific. Herfindahl indexes measuring nonlegislative and legislative jurisdiction concentrations. I use PAC contributions and issue salience to measure private and collective demands for policy benefits. Using two OLS regression models, I find that both types of demand influence the two jurisdiction advancement activities. Moreover, nonlegislative jurisdiction advances produce a nonconcentrated jurisdictional arrangement, while legislative jurisdiction advances produce a concentrated jurisdictional arrangement."

This logic is based on the observation that each succeeding stage of the legislative process has increasingly stringent rules and becomes more consequential. This logic unevenly distributes the influence of social movements across the legislative process. Social movements should have less influence at later stages where stringent requirements are more likely to exhaust limited resources and where the consequentiality of action will cause legislators to revoke their support. We apply the theory to a study of state-level woman suffrage legislation. We find that legislators responded to suffragists by bringing the issue of woman suffrage to the legislative forum, but once suffrage bills reached the voting stage, differences in social movement tactics and organization did not have as great an impact."

While the existence of such ""unique"" features of Asian political culture is undeniable, the extent of their influence over the impact of economic globalization on civil liberties is an empirical question that needs to be answered."

This article demonstrates how Congress engaged in deck-stacking, engineering the administrative structure and judicial procedures of the fugitive slave rendition process in ways that favored slave-holding interests. Analysis of votes by members of Congress on final passage of the act and amendments to the act demonstrate the political influences on choices of process. I demonstrate that regional (free versus slave state), partisan (Whig versus Democrat), and electoral (Free Soil party support) calculations all play a role in determining the likelihood of a legislator voting for the antislavery position. Moreover, political conflict was muted when amendments dealt mainly with structural issues, but was amplified when the amendment's content was procedural."

In the article, several conflict indicators are reviewed and embedded in a conceptual model. The regime's inability to provide economic and political goods is conceived as a source of discontent, or relative deprivation, within a population. This discontent is seen to be likely to result in conflict if the environment is conducive to the mobilization of resources for collective action. The validity of the indicators is tested with various techniques, including ordinary least squares, generalized least squares (error component), and Logit regression models, on a sample of 70 less developed countries in 1981-89. The dependent variables are (1) political conflict and its constituent parts, (2) political protest, (3) rebellion, and (4) irregular executive transfer. The overall extent of political conflict varies directly with poor economic performance, ethnic dominance, military centrality, urbanization and conflict tradition, inversely with the level of economic development, and is most extensive under middle levels of political authoritarianism. Economic performance seems to be more conducive to political protest and irregular executive transfer than rebellion. Urbanization and ethnic dominance are directly associated with political protest but decrease the likelihood of irregular executive transfer. The results generally corroborate the findings of 30 years of conflict research also in the Third-World context."

Using ordered probit models, I explore policy adoption under three configurations: (1) a test of the independent impact of tokens, (2) a dynamic test of the differential impact of tokens and nontokens to analyze potential backlash effects and the potential diffusion of policy preferences, and (3) an interactive test on the potential for tokens to form coalitions. My analysis strongly suggests that tokens make a policy difference independently and to a greater extent than when they are on the cusp of becoming nontokens, but I found less support for the idea that tokens successfully form coalitions to achieve specific policy goals."

One way of understanding voter reaction to propositions is to conceive of them as presenting voters with a set of decisionmaking costs which they seek to minimize. Developing hypotheses from this simple basis allows us to make a series of predictions of likely voter turnout on ballot propositions. We find that ballot position, proposition type, and spending patterns have statistically significant impacts upon the decision of voters to express a preference for or against a given proposition."

Our argument is that justices decide how to respond based on the effect a choice will have on securing their policy goals. The costs or benefits of a choice, moreover, are a function of strategic and contextual factors, including a justice's agreement with an opinion, the collaborative decision-making setting on the Court, case characteristics, and attributes of the justices. Our data analysis strongly supports our argument showing that, among other considerations, justices' responses result from their disagreement with an opinion, the author's prior level of cooperation with them, and the salience of a case."

I evaluate these hypotheses empirically using data from California state legislative races from 1976 to 2004; incorporating a variety of methods, including pooled cross-sectional time-series regression. I find evidence that state legislative term limits not only fail to achieve the reformers' goals, but they, in fact, decrease voter turnout."

For 1979-90, we use measures of geographically and non-geographically based economic interests to estimate the representative's party and ideology. We also consider the factor endowments of individuals within a district to examine their impact on floor votes. We then investigate the influence of these interests on members' party affiliation and ideology, as well as a pool of five floor votes on foreign trade, using instrumental variables for party and ideology. Economic interests account for a substantial portion of the variance in all cases, and models that also include other explanatory variables are highly accurate in estimating floor votes."

Results indicate that single-member districts, beginning at the end of a term, prior representational service, narrow vote margins and experience in seeking reelection encourage minority justices to be attentive to their constituencies by voting in accordance with constituent opinion. In essence, constituency influence in state supreme courts is enhanced by competitive electoral conditions and experience with electoral politics."

We examine trade flows between the major powers from 1907 to 1990.

In addition, Senate apportionment has had implications for the partisan composition of the Senate. When we compare the actual outcomes of Senate elections over time with hypothetical outcomes, which we derive by holding state population constant, we find that Senate apportionment has had important consequences for the partisan composition of the Senate in several periods. From the mid-1970s until (but not including) 1994, Senate apportionment enabled Republicans to hold seats disproportionate to their party's share of the national Senate vote."

From one view, political parties are essentially sincere, leading us to expect conservative or liberal dominance to yield changes in public policies that are in keeping with those ideological leanings. Another set of evidence suggests that parties are for the most part strategic, tailoring their policy outputs to electoral circumstances. We argue that parties are neither wholly sincere nor wholly strategic in their policy positions, but that they blend sincere and strategic impulses according to political conditions. We test this revised theory using cross-sectional state level data pooled over the years 1973-1992. Our results reveal the effects of party strength in government to be conditioned by electoral circumstances. For example, Democrats that dominate state legislatures but were elected in close races exert greater changes in welfare spending effort than Democrats with identical numbers of seats who were elected under less competitive elections. Thus both the number of seats and the difficulty of gaining them have policy consequences. The theory developed here provides a more consistent set of expectations regarding the effects of parties on policymaking than is otherwise drawn from existing research."

The 1972-1994 cumulative files for the General Social Surveys and the 1990 Citizen Participation Survey provide the data to test our hypotheses. The primary findings indicate that there is a strong positive relationship between the extensiveness of group membership and political tolerance. Moreover, this association grows stronger with each additional membership. Finally, after controlling for the extensiveness of group memberships, we find that membership in several specific types of groups affects political tolerance. Overall, results strongly support the social capital proposition linking group membership to political tolerance."

Thus, the impact of recession is muted by the reduced propensity of those suffering its effects to actually vote. Given this fact, it appears that the president's party is more consistently rewarded for its economic successes than it is punished for its failures."

To solve this puzzle, we estimate a cross-lagged three-equation model on data from all 50 states from 1963 to 1989 using maximum likelihood within LISREL. We find a substantial reciprocal but non-confounding relationship between representation and the allocation of benefits for the House, but not for the Senate. Thus, for the House, this more appropriate model of distributive politics in Congress supports both the committee-induced benefits hypothesis and the recruitment hypothesis. Further, the paper elaborates on how this reciprocal relationship plays out over time."

Second, while some researchers believe that gerrymandering dramatically increases partisan bias and others deny this effect, we show both sides are in a sense correct. Gerrymandering biases electoral systems in favor of the party that controls the redistricting as compared to what would have happened if the other party controlled it, but any type of redistricting reduces partisan bias as compared to an electoral system without redistricting. Incorrect conclusions in both literatures resulted from misjudging the enormous uncertainties present during redistricting periods, making simplified assumptions about the redistricters' goals, and using inferior statistical methods."

While an extensive body of research has examined these polls, we know little about the dimensions of approval generally. Based on a priori expectations derived from the institutional literature, we propose a general model that partitions approval into mutually exclusive and exhaustive components: time, circumstances, and administration. This model is applied to pooled monthly observations from the administrations of Truman through Reagan. All three components are statistically significant and together account for most of the variation in approval. We find a time curve, common to all presidents, consisting of a cycle of deflation and partial restoration of approval. From month seven on, presidents suffer a statistically significant loss of support month by month until the erosion subsides when the next election approaches. This temporal dimension, we find, also structures specific presidential activities across the term. We also find significant effects for categories of circumstances holding across all presidencies. Economic conditions and some dramatic events exerted significant effects on approval. Finally, with time and circumstances controlled, we find that a significant amount of variation in approval still exists within each administration. The results of this analysis resolve many of the conflicts in the literature and point the way to a convergence about common constraints on approval. The results also tell us more about the presidential office. They indicate that while the relationship between each administration and the public is distinctive, all of these presidents operated within the same important and significant restraints."

State repression is a function of either a unidimensional conception of domestic threats (i.e., where there is one attribute of political conflict considered by the regime) or one that is multidimensional in character (i.e., where there are several attributes considered), conditioned by certain political-economic characteristics: democracy, economic development, coercive capacity, dependency and lagged repression. A pooled cross-sectional time series analysis of 53 countries from 1948 to 1982. Three different aspects of political conflict (conflict frequency, strategic variety, and deviance from cultural norm) are statistically significant in their relationship to repression, supporting the multidimensional conception of domestic threats. Additionally, the degree to which the government is democratic significantly alters the pattern of relationships between political conflict and repressive behavior."

Relying upon a distinction between 'technical' and 'political' information, I contend that the effect of decentralizing reforms is strengthened or attenuated by the informational focus of the interest group. Using longitudinal committee testimony data (1959-92) for ten groups, I show that the mid-1970s House reforms had differential effects on environmental groups and labor unions—in part, depending on group informational focus.

Women's political presence trumps the ideology of the party in power.

In the American context, this interest has sparked research about the factors determining the nature of intraparty competition in the states. Two major explanations have emerged: the opposition hypothesis--which suggests that the strength of the opposition party is the principal determinant of intraparty competitiveness, with a weak opposition leading to strong competition--and the electoral structure hypothesis--which attributes the level of competition principally to the rules governing primaries. In particular, double (or runoff) primaries are held to offer greater incentives to politicians to compete than single primaries. Recent research about the factors determining the competitiveness of gubernatorial primaries has found stronger empirical support for the structure proposition than the opposition hypothesis. We reformulate these hypotheses in a model that presumes that electoral structure and opposition strength interact in influencing the level of competition in gubernatorial primaries such that the effect of structure on competition depends on the strength of the opposition party. Pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis of data from the states extending as far back as 1919 produces strong support for our model, leading to the conclusion that both electoral structure and opposition party strength influence the competitiveness of primaries. The empirical evidence also confirms the importance of incumbency, restrictions on gubernatorial succession, and party endorsements in determining competitiveness."

OLS estimations and other analyses show that the median faction in the Italian Christian Democratic Party was advantaged in intraparty competition over governing office. Overall, predictions based on a norm of proportionality-to-faction-size evince greater explanatory power than do bargaining set predictions. Variations in the degree of proportionality testify to the interplay between coalition choices and faction payoffs.

At the same time an electoral shift resulted in parties of the left holding government positions in 13 of 15 member states, a marked contrast to the recent past. We examine if recent electoral fluctuations can be attributed to the traditional explanations of economic voting and anti-incumbency or if there is evidence of a fundamental shift in the electoral arena following the passage of the Maastricht Treaty. Using pooled cross-sectional data for the years 1983-1998, we find that for both EMU members and non-members traditional forces help explain electoral outcomes, however an indicator for the squeeze of the post-Maastricht time period also plays a significant role. While left parties have fared well in the post-Maastricht period, the strong, negative effect of incumbency, persistent unemployment, and an overall increase in electoral volatility make any conclusions of a left turn in the member states of the EU premature. Rather, it is likely left parties will find themselves faced with the difficult task of maintaining support while abiding by the constraints imposed by the Maastricht Treaty."

Dummy-variable specifications are shown to underestimate the eventual impact of motor voter. Models include state dummy variables to control for long-standing differences in participation rates across states that otherwise bias coefficient estimates for registration closing date and other variables.

However, studies at the presidential level have failed to consider candidate quality, prior vulnerability of the incumbent president or his party, the national nature of the presidential race, and the unique context of each presidential election campaign. Once these factors are taken into account presidential primaries should have a more marginal or even nonexistent effect in understanding general election outcomes. Hypothesis: Including appropriate controls for election year context in a state-by-state model and creating a national model that controls for election year context, candidate quality, and the nature of the times should diminish the effect of nomination divisiveness on general election outcomes. Methods: Regression analysis is used to examine the effect of presidential divisive nomination campaigns on general election outcomes. Results: Once election year context in the state-by-state model is controlled for, divisiveness has a much more modest effect. This modest effect does not appear to change general election outcomes. In addition, the election year model, which posits that presidential elections are national elections and not state-by-state elections, indicated that divisiveness was not significantly different from zero."

Past values of democracy are found to affect repression negatively for five years and past values of dissident behavior are found to affect repression positively for seven years.

Fording,American Journal of Political Science,41,1,1997-01-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 1-29,Midwest Political Science Association,fla,,"Political elites, in their efforts to exercise social control while maintaining legitimacy, respond to civil unrest by expanding the relief rolls. This response is not guaranteed, however, and is highly dependent upon the numerical strength of the insurgent group, access to democratic electoral institutions, and the relationship between the insurgent group and the rest of society. The theory is tested by examining the impact of black insurgency in the United States on AFDC growth. In the absence of effective black electoral access, if insurgency has any impact at all, it should be weakest where white resistence is strong. In the presence of effective electoral access, insurgency will have a positive effect on AFDC growth, and will be most effective where white resistance is weak, or where black electoral power is strong. Pooled time-series analysis is used to examine growth in state AFDC recipient rates during the years 1962-80. The results provide strong evidence that political violence can bring important benefits to insurgent groups in the United States. Benefits are not guaranteed, however, and appear to be contingent upon the hypothesized contextual variables. In the case of the United States, these variables appear to have interacted in a complex fashion to produce a rather unexpected outcome. Political violence was most effective in the areas where white resistance was strongest, due to the dominance of black electoral power, and where black electoral power was weakest, due to a more tolerant white electorate."

Gillion,The Journal of Politics,74,4,2012-10-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 950-962,"Cambridge University Press, Southern Political Science Association",fla,,"Although minority protest is often characterized as an effective form of political participation, previous research has been unsuccessful in establishing a direct link between protest activity and congressional support for minority interests. However, the shortcoming of the existing literature is related to an analytical focus at the aggregate level, where only the passage of congressional legislation and national-level protest events are considered. By linking district-level minority protest actions to individual roll-call votes on race, I hypothesize that minority activism can indicate constituency preferences and inform legislators' votes. This analytical approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the influence that citizens' behavior has on congressional policy. Using protest data and congressional roll-call votes from the 87th to the 101st Congress, the empirical analysis demonstrates that representatives are attuned to the social conditions of their district and use minority protest as an informative cue that shapes their congressional voting behavior."

Previous research offers a variety of sometimes conflicting explanations, but the available evidence is insufficient to determine which explanations are valid. This article seeks to contribute to the resolution of this controversy by empirically examining five prominent theories of support for integration. Through regression analyses of Eurobarometer surveys from the period 1978-1992, the analysis shows that the partisan context of integrative reforms and the utilitarian consequences of integrative policy provide robust explanations for variation in support. In contrast, two other prominent theories-political values and cognitive mobilization-are only valid in a limited context, and in this context they exert a small substantive impact on support."

Wang,International Studies Quarterly,43,1,1999-03-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 199-210,"The International Studies Association, Wiley",fla,,"Many previous studies assessed the effectiveness of U.S. foreign aid by focusing on voting coincidence rates of all UN votes and found no relationship between U.S. aid distribution and UN voting coincidence rates. Most UN resolutions, however, are simply not important enough for the U.S. to expend its scarce resources in influencing the outcomes. The U.S. government would not be likely to exercise pressure on all UN resolutions but would do so on issues considered vital to America's national interests. If there is any effect from receiving U.S. foreign aid on political outcomes in the UN, it is therefore most likely to emerge in voting coincidence rates on important issues. Using data collected for sixty-five developing countries between 1984 and 1993, a pooled cross-sectional and time-series research design is adopted to examine this hypothesis. Contrary to the argument that foreign aid is an ineffective policy instrument in the pursuit of America's global influence, the current findings suggest that the U.S. government has successfully utilized foreign aid programs to induce foreign policy compliance in the UN on issues that are vital to America's national interests."

The model gives testable predictions about how patterns of federal spending respond to changes in government. Some of the predictions are consistent with conventional wisdom, namely that the SPD-FDP government decreased spending on right-wing items when it came to power in 1969, and the return of CDU-FDP coalition in 1982 produced a decline in left-wing spending. Other predictions are less intuitive. For example, there is no predicted increase in left-wing spending associated with the SPD-FDP coalition and no increase in right-wing spending with the CDU-FDP government. These predictions, and those of competing models, are tested using disaggregated budget data from fiscal years 1961-1989, controlling for category-specific effects and economic conditions. The data support the veto players model, and this support is robust to a wide variety of plausible assumptions about the parties' spending preferences."

Multivariate analyses of 102 elections in 19 industrialized democracies are used to estimate the cross-national impact of economic and political factors. The analyses show that considerations of the ideological image of the government, its electoral base, and the clarity of its political responsibility are essential to understanding the effects of economic conditions on voting for or against incumbents."

However, the explanation of policy position variation across members does not explain aggregate policy decisions by Congress. Moreover, while these data are appropriate to explain the causes of policy-position variation across members, the attempt to econometrically isolate members' ideology from other causes has not been successful because important causes of decisions have not been included in the regression equations. Finally, roll-call votes are not a random sample of congressional decisions. Inferences made from roll calls have three sources of error. First, the processes that determine committee and voice-vote decisions are different from those that determine roll-call decisions. Second, the estimates of factor effects on decisions generated from roll-call data will be much too large, because they do not take account of the probability that a proposal receives committee approval and is subject to a roll call. Finally, the unknown causes of roll-call occurrence are correlated with the unknown causes of the actual roll-call decision creating biased coefficients even if the probability of events prior to roll-call passage have been taken into account."

Measures of both gubernatorial influence and administrator contact with gubernatorial staff are regressed on gubernatorial approval ratings from state polling data, along with controls for other state characteristics.

The model specifies presidential elections as a function of long-term and short-term, political and economic, state-level and national variables. Several important findings emerge from the analysis. First, state-level presidential election outcomes are not responsive only to state or national factors but are reflections of both. The state of the national economy, presidential incumbency and popularity, state political ideology, and partisanship are found to be the most important determinants of presidential election outcomes. Second, although not as powerful, there is evidence of a fairly strong presidential home state advantage, as well as a somewhat weaker home region advantage. No such advantage is found for vice-presidential candidates. Finally, national factors are found to improve the accuracy of the model in some states (mostly Plains and Mountain West states) much more than in other states."

In addition, there is some evidence that divided/coalition governments and uncertainty reduce compliance. Theoretical and policy implications of the findings are discussed."

Many studies suggest a minimal effect, but it is possible that a more significant influence might be found with better data on the key dependent and independent variables. This study uses data on presidential candidates' appearances and television advertising purchases to conduct cross-sectional and pooled time-series analyses of their influence on statewide outcomes in 1988, 1992, and 1996. The data demonstrate that, despite the conditioning influence of other factors, campaigning affected statewide preferences as well as the electoral college vote."

According to the liberal neoclassical school, the acceptance of liberal economic doctrine will provide positive political benefits to developing countries. The ""dependency"" school, on the other hand, argues that because ties between core and periphery elites give governments in developing nations an incentive to repress, human rights conditions will worsen as foreign economic penetration increases. The results of previous empirical queries into this matter have been mixed. In contrast to most studies, we focus on a broader measure of foreign economic capital, including foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, debt, and official development assistance. Using ordered logit analysis on a cross-national sample of forty-three developing countries from 1981 to 1995, we discover systematic evidence of an association between foreign economic penetration and government respect for two types of human rights, physical integrity rights and political rights and civil liberties. Of particular interest is the finding that both foreign direct investment and portfolio investment are reliably associated with increased government respect for human rights."
