10.2307/2110649,Linear Models for Evaluating Conditional Relationships,"Gerald C. Wright, Jr.",American Journal of Political Science,20,2,1976-05-01,pp. 349-373,"Relationships among the variables in political and sociological analyses are often conditional; the magnitudes of relationships frequently change among different types of people, and in different contexts. A common practice in studying such relationships has been to calculate and compare correlation coefficients, or other standardized measures of association, among subsets of observations defined by the conditioning variable. This method is criticized, and in its place we advocate a general linear model approach to assessing the extent of change in relationships among groups of observations. The approach consists of comparing a series of linear regression models with three criteria being offered for evaluating differences among the models. The analysis strategy is then illustrated in partial replications of two earlier studies.",One-way(Within),10*2,Cohen (1968) and Fennessey (1968),,

This essay deals briefly with the potential applications of pooled design and more extensively with the special statistical problems commonly associated with analysis in space and time together. Four estimators--ordinary least squares, least squares with dummy variables, error components, and an adaptation of Box-Jenkins ARMA models to the pooled estimation problem--are reviewed, with an effort to suggest where each may find application in political science research. The four estimators are then illustrated by analysis of the regional dynamics in party issue polarization over issues of racial desegregation in the U.S. House of Representatives",One-way(Within),NA,Wallace and Hussain (1968),,

The framework is a synthesis of the dominant political and economic approaches to this issue: it attempts to capture key elements of the complex political and administrative processes that implementation research has identified in contemporary federalism, and to exploit formal models of local fiscal choice used to analyze the impact of federal grants on state and local spending and taxing. The vehicle for the synthesis is a principal-agent model which represents the federal system as a formal hierarchy extending from Congress and the president to subnational bureaucrats. An econometric analysis of two major federal grant programs in each state for the years, 1965-1979, demonstrates that 1) economic models alone cannot explain the effects of federal grants on subnational fiscal behavior; politics must be included, and 2) the political effects can be disaggregated into ideological and constituency-oriented demands made by Congress and the White House on federal grant agencies.",One-way(Within),50*15,Pindyck & Rubinfeld (1981) and Maddalla (1977) and Craig & Inman (1982),Linear Trend,

Gibson",The American Political Science Review,81,3,1987-09-01,pp. 961-966,"A current debate within the field of U.S. politics revolves around the extent to which the electorate is nationalized, that is, responds to national-level political forces. We provide additional evidence to help resolve this debate. Using the variance-components model of political effects developed by Stokes, we analyze presidential, senatorial, gubernatorial, and congressional races for the period 1962-1984. The results indicate that presidential races are highly nationalized, and congressional races largely localized. Senate and gubernatorial races are found to have a large state-level component to them. The analysis is also split into two segments to ascertain if a change in political effects is seen during this relatively short time frame; no such differences are found. We conclude that nationalization is not a process that can be understood from evidence provided by congressional races alone. Our results suggest that constituencies respond to political forces in a complex way, reacting to factors that are most relevant to a particular electoral contest.",Unclear,,,,

I investigate institutionalization's effects on the vulnerability of state elections to major periodic forces--coattails, turnout, and economic conditions--and how political responsibility for economic growth is apportioned between presidents and governors in state elections. The investigation relies upon dynamic models of state legislative and gubernatorial outcomes estimated with a pooled data set comprised of most states and electionsin the years 1940-82. The results, which have important implications for state government more broadly, indicate that institutionalization has substantially insulated legislative elections against major threats and that state legislators and governors have less to fear from their state economies than is often thought, but also that state elections are becoming more susceptible to swings in the national economy.",One-way(Within),35*22,Stimson (1985),Lagged DV,

This alternative to centralized democratic controls over bureaucracy occurs because discretionary policy decisions made at the field office level are influenced by local resources generated through partisan activities. Our study of county-level Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforcement in New York (1976-85) finds that county, state, and federal elected officials influence local enforcement.

We estimate the effects of several tax policy variables while controlling for rival political and economic factors that are believed to influence voting at this level--state and national economic conditions, partisan strength, national trends, and coterminous contests. Results indicate weak overall negative electoral effects of taxation; only changes in the general sales tax programs appear to have significant impacts.

Canon",The Journal of Politics,55,2,1993-05-01,pp. 454-471,"Political scientists have devoted considerable effort to explaining the extent of electoral division in democracies. In the American context, this interest has sparked research about the factors determining the nature of intraparty competition in the states. Two major explanations have emerged: the opposition hypothesis--which suggests that the strength of the opposition party is the principal determinant of intraparty competitiveness, with a weak opposition leading to strong competition--and the electoral structure hypothesis--which attributes the level of competition principally to the rules governing primaries. In particular, double (or runoff) primaries are held to offer greater incentives to politicians to compete than single primaries. Recent research about the factors determining the competitiveness of gubernatorial primaries has found stronger empirical support for the structure proposition than the opposition hypothesis. We reformulate these hypotheses in a model that presumes that electoral structure and opposition strength interact in influencing the level of competition in gubernatorial primaries such that the effect of structure on competition depends on the strength of the opposition party. Pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis of data from the states extending as far back as 1919 produces strong support for our model, leading to the conclusion that both electoral structure and opposition party strength influence the competitiveness of primaries. The empirical evidence also confirms the importance of incumbency, restrictions on gubernatorial succession, and party endorsements in determining competitiveness.",One-way(Within),88*9,Stimson (1985) and Hsiao (1986),,

It develops a public good model of welfare policymaking focused on changes in the maximum benefit level that determines how much assistance poor families receive. A pooled time-series analysis is used to test the model's expectations. This examination confirms some expectations of the public good theory while challenging others. Changes in state revenues strongly influence states' decisions about AFDC benefit levels. However, neither changes in citizens' income nor changes in the cost of living have a significant effect on states' decisions. These findings question the public good theory's focus on transfers from private income and its characterization of concern for the living conditions of poor families as the central motive for welfare transfers. They indicate that the explanation of AFDC policymaking should be focused on the role of state policymaking processes, particularly the budgetary process.",Two-way,50*8,Stimson (1985),,

In so doing, our analysis resolves two long-standing controversies in American politics. First, whereas some scholars believe that redistricting reduces electoral responsiveness by protecting incumbents, others, that the relationship is spurious, we demonstrate that both sides are wrong: redistricting increases responsiveness. Second, while some researchers believe that gerrymandering dramatically increases partisan bias and others deny this effect, we show both sides are in a sense correct. Gerrymandering biases electoral systems in favor of the party that controls the redistricting as compared to what would have happened if the other party controlled it, but any type of redistricting reduces partisan bias as compared to an electoral system without redistricting. Incorrect conclusions in both literatures resulted from misjudging the enormous uncertainties present during redistricting periods, making simplified assumptions about the redistricters' goals, and using inferior statistical methods.",One-way(Within),,Stimson (1985) and Hsiao (1986),Lagged DV,

Using state-level registration and turnout data over the 1976-1992 period, this study finds that motor voter programs already implemented in many states have significantly increased participation rates. A duration-based specification of motor voter is employed, to account for the fact that driver's license renewal cycles last up to six years or even more in some states. Dummy-variable specifications are shown to underestimate the eventual impact of motor voter. Models include state dummy variables to control for long-standing differences in participation rates across states that otherwise bias coefficient estimates for registration closing date and other variables. In contrast to motor voter, other provisions required by the NVRA--including mail-in and agency-based registration, and limitations on the purging of voter rolls--show little evidence of effectiveness in the states where they have already been implemented.",Two-way,51*9,,,

First we ask to what degree elections to the U.S. House of Representatives may be understood to reflect the influence of current public opinion? This requires us to entertain models of House elections with incumbency effects as a dynamic system. We ask, second, how do the effects of exogenous influences of all sorts work their way into ultimate House composition? Third, we ask if some portion of the effects attributed to incumbency might not be simply these dynamics, reasserted effects of previous elections, in addition to the well-known advantages individual incumbents accrue? We estimate pooled models of state-level aggregate voting for the House. We add Policy Mood to the usual set of explanations as a means to specify the central focus of democratic theories of elections. We focus on how incumbency translates contemporaneous effects of the explanatory variables into dynamic effects and on how this translation differentially affects the various inputs to the system.",One-way(Within),50*34,,Lagged DV,

Both factors are likely to promote trade among members, but we argue that the interaction between them is central to explaining patterns of commerce. The combination of an alliance, which creates political incentives for participants to engage in trade, and a commercial institution, which liberalizes trade among members, is expected to provide a considerable impetus to commerce among parties to both. The results of our quantitative analyses support these arguments. Both alliances and preferential trading arrangements strongly affected trade from 1960 to 1990, and allies that included a major power conducted considerably more trade than their nonmajor-power counterparts. Moreover, the interaction between alliances and preferential trading arrangements is fundamental to explaining patterns of bilateral commerce: Parties to a common preferential trading arrangement and a common alliance engage in markedly greater trade than do members of either type of institution but not both.",Two-way,*7,,"Lagged DV, White SE",

They also care about their institution. In order to secure as much as they can of policy goals and protect their institution, they adjust policy decisions at the margins in response to mass public opinion. Individual Supreme Court justice liberalism depends on shifts in mass public opinion through time. We test hypotheses using pooled time series cross-section analysis, with the individual justice-term as the unit of analysis. Controlling for the changing composition of the Court, attitudinal inertia of justices, and the strength of judicial ideologies, we find that public opinion directly affects decisions by individual members of the Court. We show that the result holds across various issue areas, is not restricted to only a few justices, and that the justices' responses are relatively quick with a lag of only one term.",One-way(Within),22*43,,Newey West SE,

A specific area in which they are amenable to empirical tests is the House of Representatives' use of rules governing the amendment process. Dion and Huber (1996) propose and test a formal model of the choice of rules that lies solidly within the partisan or majority-party-leadership class of theory and also comports well with conventional wisdom about rules and their strategic uses by the majority party. The Dion-Huber theory identifies a necessary condition for open rules: that the House median voter lies interior to the Rules Committee median and the standing committee median. This condition defines a rule profile that Dion and Huber show helps to predict rule assignments. Informational and distributive theories yield additional hypotheses, only one of which Dion and Huber test. (1) Replication and extension of Dion and Huber's tests using their committee-level data set, OLS, GLS, and fixed-effects estimations. (2) Joint tests of the rule-profile hypothesis with informational and distributive hypotheses using a rule-level data set and probit analysis. In the committee-level data set, the rule-profile effect is sensitive to model specification. In the rule-level data set and in the presence of both informational and distributive variables, the rule-profile effect is barely or not at all distinguishable from zero.

Results: The odds of corporate versus individual audits increase with increased Democratic control over Congress and change with different presidential administrations, but not with changes in state-level partisanship.

I hypothesize that the levels of these competing demands drive two activities changing committee jurisdiction concentrations: ""nonlegislative"" and ""legislative"" jurisdiction advances. To test my hypotheses, I use nonlegislative committee hearings and bill referrals over a 15-year period (1979-93) to construct annual, issue-specific. Herfindahl indexes measuring nonlegislative and legislative jurisdiction concentrations. I use PAC contributions and issue salience to measure private and collective demands for policy benefits.

The results show that accountability is generally stronger following a period of unified party control than under divided government. Voter reactions to taxes and spending relative to the state economy are conditional on expectations, which differ for each party. Net of these expectations, Republican gubernatorial candidates lose votes if their party is responsible for unanticipated increases in the size of the state budget; Democrats do not and, indeed, may be rewarded for small increases. Independent of this, the incumbent governor's party is punished in legislative elections for failing to maintain fiscal balance.

The adjusted scores for the ADA show a strong liberal trend in the average member of Congress during 1947-94, followed by a conservative reversal. A nonparametric test using ADA and ACU scores demonstrates the validity of adjusted scores and the invalidity of nominal scores for intertemporal and interchamber comparisons.

In this paper, institutional and political determinants of pay inequality are studied in sixteen countries from 1980 to 1992. The most important factor in explaining pay dispersion is the level of wage-setting, i.e., whether wages are set at the level of the individual, the plant, the industry, or the entire private sector. The impact of centralization is the same whether centralization occurs via collective bargaining or via government involvement in private-sector wage-setting. The concentration of unions and the share of the labor force covered by collective bargaining agreements also matter. After controlling for wage-setting institutions, other variables such as the governing coalition, the size of government, international openness, and the supply of highly educated workers have little impact.

The model gives testable predictions about how patterns of federal spending respond to changes in government. Some of the predictions are consistent with conventional wisdom, namely that the SPD-FDP government decreased spending on right-wing items when it came to power in 1969, and the return of CDU-FDP coalition in 1982 produced a decline in left-wing spending. Other predictions are less intuitive. For example, there is no predicted increase in left-wing spending associated with the SPD-FDP coalition and no increase in right-wing spending with the CDU-FDP government. These predictions, and those of competing models, are tested using disaggregated budget data from fiscal years 1961-1989, controlling for category-specific effects and economic conditions. The data support the veto players model, and this support is robust to a wide variety of plausible assumptions about the parties' spending preferences.",One-way(Within),*28,,White SE,

The analysis provides little evidence that financial integration has eliminated distinct partisan macroeconomic policies. Under fixed exchange rates leftist governments run larger deficits than rightist governments and use capital controls to reduce interest rate premia. Under floating exchange rates leftist governments pursue looser monetary policies than rightist governments. While partisan distinctions do weaken in the 1990s in countries with fixed exchange rates, this is attributed to the recession of the early 1990s and to important institutional changes in the European Union.

Initial results run contrary to the ideological-boots thesis, as I uncover low levels of cross-system stability among members who moved from the U.S. House to the Confederate House. Examining further, I argue that high levels of ideological stability follow from a strong party system being in place to structure voting, which has traditionally been the case in the two-party U.S. House but was not the case in the partyless Confederate House. This result aside, I do find a moderate but increasing level of ideological stability among members of the Confederate House in a session-by-session analysis, which is robust to a serious ""shock"" (Federal invasion) to the constituency-representative linkage underlying the electoral connection.

A third party is uninformed about the president's preferences; however, by observing the bill that Congress writes and the president's veto decisions, it can learn about these preferences. Since in our model the president wants to appear moderate to voters, while Congress wants him to appear extreme, Congress sometimes writes a bill that it knows the president will veto.

We attempt to provide such evidence by turning to the docket books of Chief Justice Waite (1874-1888) and making the following argument: if a norm of consensus induced unanimity on Courts of by-gone eras, then the norm may have manifested itself through public unanimity in the face of private conference disagreements.

Using a panel design, we explain state funding allocations to 8,048 local school districts from 1992 through 1996. The statistical results show that the relative emphasis on equity differs substantially across states based on political values. States with conservative citizens and institutions place less emphasis on revenue equity than states with liberal citizens and institutions.

The theory suggests that the level of policy congruence between recipient jurisdictions and the national government will determine the amount of grant funding diverted away from targeted policy areas. Findings from analyses of grant programs in two distinct policy areas support the hypothesis that grant effectiveness is partially a function of goal congruence. The relationship between intergovernmental partners is interactive, with the degree of policy agreement determining fund diversion in subnational jurisdictions, as well as the effectiveness of federal oversight activities.

Our key insight is that political costs that accompany legislating have both direct and indirect effects on the likelihood and scale of reforms. While countries with higher political costs are less likely themselves to enact reforms, the presence of these costs also reduces competing countries' incentives to reform regardless of their own political costs. Domestic politics therefore mitigates the pressures for downward convergence of tax policy despite increased capital mobility. We examine the capital tax policies in OECD countries during the period from 1980 to 1997 and find that states are sensitive to tax reforms in competitor countries, although their responses to reforms are mediated by their own domestic costs to reform. We define two potential sources of political costs of reform: transaction costs, due to the presence of multiple veto players in the legislative process, and constituency costs, due to ideological opposition to policy changes that benefit capital. Our evidence reveals that a reduction in these costs either domestically or abroad increases the likelihood that a country enacts tax reforms.",One-way(Within),25*17,Beck (2001),"PCSEs, Lagged DV",

I find evidence that pressure destabilizes in a large panel of cross-country time-series data. The destabilization finding indicates that sanctions may be more effective at altering policies than we think. I conclude by noting that greater optimism regarding the effectiveness of sanctions should be balanced by a careful consideration of the policy's real and sizeable costs for those caught in the middle.",One-way(Within),136*80,"Beck, Katz and Tucker (1998)",,

I argue that the interests of private actors (district constituencies and interest groups) have an important effect on member voting. Following Stolper-Samuelson reasoning, I find that a member is significantly more likely to favor (oppose) rescues as the proportion of high-skilled (low-skilled) workers in a district increases. In addition, I find that campaign contributions from international banks increase the probability that a member will vote in favor of rescues.

By increasing the transparency of some policies relative to others, democracy induces politicians to reduce transparent trade barriers but also to replace them with less transparent ones. I test this hypothesis by examining the impact of democracy on tariffs, ""core"" nontariff barriers (NTBs) such as quotas, and ""quality"" NTBs such as product standards in 75 countries in the 1990s.

Presidential systems matter for budget balances because they generate relatively high incentives for governments to keep budgets under control. They do so because in presidential systems, unlike in parliamentary systems, voters are by design able to identify and punish those responsible for economic policies. Presidents, however, vary in their capacity to affect budget policies.

We note first that most of the third-party voting in the pre-New-Deal era was for left-wing third parties and that this declined sharply during the 1930s and 1940s. We then show that after the New Deal the Democratic Party's electoral support was higher in areas that had traditionally supported left-wing third parties. Contrary to some claims in the literature, we find little support for the hypothesis that the decline of third-party voting was immediately due to electoral reforms such as the introduction of direct primaries and the Australian ballot, except possibly in the south.",Two-way,,,White SEs,

To understand how vital these outsiders are to legislative partisanship, this article takes advantage of a particular natural experiment: the state of California's experience with cross-filing (1914-59), under which institutional rules prevented outsiders from influencing party nominations. Under cross-filing, legislative partisanship collapsed, demonstrating that incumbents tend to prefer nonpartisanship or fake partisanship to actual ideological combat. Partisanship quickly returned once these outsiders could again dominate nominations. Several other historical examples reveal extralegislative actors exerting considerably greater influence over members' voting behavior than intralegislative party institutions did.

Our findings thus differ from the conventional wisdom on several scores, particularly by emphasizing the ways in which good rather than bad economic conditions can facilitate reforms, the conditionality of legislative politics of reform enactment on whether reforms are characterized by ex ante conflict or fears of ex post blame, and how the type of reform shapes its political dynamics.",One-way(Within),19*14,,,

Lame-duck sessions of Congress are comprised of exiting members, who are freed from both constituency and party constraints, and returning members, who face a significantly reduced constituency constraint but a still strongparty constraint. Comparing exiting and returning House members thus provides meaningful leverage in assessing the constraining influence of party. In the regularly occurring lame-duck sessions between 1877 and 1933, exiting House members exhibited greater movement away from the median party position than did returning members, consistent with expectations regardingparty influence. In addition, party leaders' ability to apply pressure was significantly reduced in lame-duck sessions due to the presence of a large group of exiting members. Finally, majority-party leaders were able to exercise negative agenda control in lame-duck sessions when their party maintained control of the next Congress, but they often acted to roll their own party members (an occurrence we dub a ""strategic roll"") when their party lost control of the next Congress, as a way to minimize policy loss. In the post-1933 era, after the passage of the 20th Amendment, lame-duck sessions (those portions of the second session that stretch beyond the November elections) are more accurately characterized as extensions of regular sessions, with party leaders' ability to pressure members and exercise negative agenda control remaining virtually constant across sessions.

Matching public voter turnout records in Los Angeles to a twin registry, we study the heritability of political behavior in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. The results show that a significant proportion of the variation in voting turnout can be accounted for by genes. We also replicate these results with data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and show that they extend to a broad class of acts of political participation. These are the first findings to suggest that humans exhibit genetic variation in their tendency to participate in political activities.",One-way(Time),396*8,,,

Based on a statistical analysis of 34 countries around the world between 1945 and 2003, this study finds that electoral systems influence the electoral strength of independent candidates by defining the opportunities for independents to compete for office (i.e., ballot access requirements), the degree to which politics is candidate centered versus partisan driven (i.e., majority/plurality rule, district magnitude, open-list PR, and democratic transitions), and the extent to which small vote getters win seats (i.e., district size and electoral thresholds).

We find that the occurrence of a terror attack in a given locality within three moths of the elections causes an increase of 1.35 percentage points on that locality's support for the right bloc of political parties out of the two blocs vote. This effect is of a significant political magnitude because of the high level of terrorism in Israel and the fact that its electorate is closely split between the right and left blocs. Moreover, a terror fatality has important electoral effects beyond the locality where the attack is perpetrated, and its electoral impact is stronger the closer to the elections it occurs. Interestingly, in left-leaning localities, local terror fatalities cause an increase in the support for the right bloc, whereas terror fatalities outside the locality increase the support for the left bloc of parties. Given that a relatively small number of localities suffer terror attacks, we demonstrate that terrorism does cause the ideological polarization of the electorate. Overall, our analysis provides strong empirical support for the hypothesis that the electorate shows a highly sensitive reaction to terrorism.",One-way(Within),224*6,,,

These international commitments are more credible than domestic policy choices, because reneging on them is more costly. Statistical analyses for 122 developing countries from 1970 to 2000 support this argument.

These political incentives are likely to drive the parties in Congress farther apart on presidential initiatives than they would be in the absence of presidential leadership.

It distinguishes between unobserved heterogeneity caused by fixed individual characteristics and the initial conditions problem, which occurs when voting behavior in a previous, but unobserved, period influences current voting behavior. It finds that, controlling for fixed effects, unobserved heterogeneity has little impact on the estimated degree of habit in voter turnout; however, failing to control for initial conditions reduces the estimate by a half.

This allows us to identify both the direct office-holder benefits and the incumbent quality advantage over nonincumbent candidates from the same party. We find that the overall incumbency advantage is of similar magnitude as that found in previous studies. We attribute approximately half of this advantage to incumbents' quality advantage over open-seat candidates and the remainder to direct office-holder benefits.

In large elections, pivot probability is small, so expressive preferences become more important relative to material self-interest. Ethical expressive preferences can have a disproportionate impact on results in large elections for two reasons. As pivot probability declines, ethical expressive motivations make agents more likely to vote on the basis of ethical considerations than on the basis of narrow self-interest, and the set of agents who choose to vote increasingly consist of agents with large ethical expressive payoffs.

At the same time, economic and fiscal decentralization increased the capacity of local leaders to influence government budget expenditures as the need rises.

However, the majority party has a greater degree of control over spending than the minority party. This implies that the majority leadership is able to ""protect"" projects which are electorally beneficial to their party's vulnerable members, but the minority leadership is not.

Catholic indigenous parishioners empowered by competition demanded the same benefits their Protestant neighbors were receiving: social services, ecclesiastic decentralization, and the practice of religion in their own language. Unable to decentralize ecclesiastic hierarchies, and facing a reputation deficit for having sided with rich and powerful elites for centuries, Catholic clergy stepped into the secular realm and became active promoters of indigenous movements and ethnic identities; they embraced the cause of the Indians as a member retention strategy and not in response to new doctrinal ideas emanating from Vatican II.

I also analyze the individual performance of chief executives statistically. The findings suggest that the standard by which we should judge the performance of chief executives cannot be conceived in isolation of the conditions under which they operate.

The importance of this benefit varies with the natural resource endowment. In resource-rich countries, bureaucratic incentives are less important for the dictator; hence, media freedom is less likely to emerge. Using panel data, we show that controlling for country fixed effects, media are less free in oil-rich economies, with the effect especially pronounced in nondemocratic regimes.

Whereas regime type is typically measured using linear or binary indicators of democracy/autocracy derived from the 21-point Polity scale, the model uses a nonlinear five-category measure of regime type based on the Polity components.

We test this hypothesis on data for 87 countries from 1975 to 2002.

Less convincingly, democratization and voter turnout also increased total tax revenue.

Using county-lev el data from the 1948-2000 presidential elections, we find support for each hypothesis. Failing to address the endogeneity problem would lead researchers to incorrectly reject all but the Anti-Incumbent Hypothesis.

Over the past two decades, migrant remittances have emerged as a significant source of external finance for developing countries, often exceeding conventional sources of capital such as foreign direct investment and bank lending. Remittances are unlike nearly all other capital flows in that they are stable and move counter cyclically relative to the recipient country's economy. As a result, they mitigate the costs of forgone domestic monetary policy autonomy and also serve as an international risk-sharing mechanism for developing countries. The observable implication of these arguments is that remittances increase the likelihood that policy makers adopt fixed exchange rates. An analysis of data on de facto exchange rate regimes and a newly available data set on remittances for up to 74 developing countries from 1982 to 2006 provides strong support for these arguments. The results are robust to instrumental variable analysis and the inclusion of multiple economic and political variables.",Two-way,74*14,,,

When institutions that hold elected officials accountable to voters are strong, businessmen receive little preferential treatment and are disinclined to run for office. When such institutions are weak, businessmen can subvert policy irrespective of whether they hold office, but they may run for office to avoid the cost of lobbying elected officials. Evidence from Russian gubernatorial elections supports the model's predictions.

When dictatorships need cooperation from society and face a potentially strong opposition, they attempt to coopt workers to reinforce their bases of support. As instruments of cooptation, legislatures and parties are useful in facilitating a political exchange between regimes and labor: dictatorships provide material benefits to workers in exchange for labor's quiescence. As a result, institutionalized dictatorships provide more benefits to workers and experience lower levels of labor protest than their noninstitutionalized counterparts.

We solve both puzzles with a model that integrates two central debates in the comparative political economy of advanced economies: one linking wage bargaining, incomes policy, and competitiveness, and the other linking partisanship, political institutions, and redistribution. We bring the two together by emphasizing the role of skill formation. We argue that union centralization is necessary for wage restraint and training on a large scale, but this in turn requires a political coalition that subsidizes such training. When both are present, wage restraint generates external competitiveness, whereas wage compression pushes up sheltered prices and hence the real exchange rate, and vice versa.

We resolve this problem by exploiting the transcripts of query sessions in the Vietnamese National Assembly, where delegates question the prime minister and Cabinet members on important issues of the day. Using a content analysis of queries, we offer the first empirical test of delegate behavior in nondemocratic parliaments. We find that some delegates exhibit behavior consistent with cooptation theory by actively participating in sessions, demonstrating criticism of authorities, and responding to the needs of local constituents.

Which response a leader chooses depends upon existing institutions and the structure of government finances. These factors also affect the likelihood and direction of institutional change.

My findings are generally consistent with these polarization hypotheses.

Democratizing states that receive high levels of democracy assistance are less likely to experience civil conflict than countries that receive little or no external democracy assistance. During democratic transitions, the central authority weakens and uncertainty about future political commitments and promises among domestic groups increases. Democracy aid decreases the risk of conflict by reducing commitment problems and uncertainty. Using an instrumental variables approach that accounts for potential endogeneity problems in aid allocation, we find empirical support for our argument. We conclude that there is a potential path to democracy that ameliorates the perils of democratization, and democracy assistance programs can play a significant positive role in this process.",One-way(Within),76*23,,,

However, voters receive limited information about international developments, biased towards the policy choices of large and proximate countries.

The electorate cares about ideology and valence, and both primary and general elections may reveal candidate valences. Our main theoretical result is that while primaries raise the expected quality of a party's candidates, they may hurt the ex ante preferred party in a competitive electorate by increasing the chances of revealing the opposing party's candidates as superior. Thus, primaries are adopted in relatively extreme districts where a clear favorite party exists.

Ten-year data on infant mortality changes following civil wars ending 1970â€“96 and a variety of robustness checks support the hypothesis.

To do so, governments can rewrite regulations (de jure policy change) and/or lower the enforcement of existing regulations (de facto policy change). In contrast with defacto changes, de jure policy changes are more likely to invite opposition from pro-environment constituencies, and are therefore politically more difficult. Our analysis of 140 countries for the period 1980-2003 suggests that in response to trade pressures, governments do not lower regulatory stringency by rewriting (de jure) environmental regulations for any level of domestic constraints. In contrast, when political constraints are low, governments respond to trade pressures by adjusting regulatory stringency via de facto changes. Moreover, in the context of de facto policy changes, the constraining effect of veto players is more pronounced for air pollution (sulphur dioxide) in comparison to water pollution (biochemical oxygen demand).

Unilateral executive powers allow elected executives to pursue policies consistent with their short-term electoral incentives. This proposition is tested by analyzing the relationship between the exercise of unilateral executive control over fiscal policymaking and fiscal-spending growth in the American states. The empirical evidence reveals that exercising some amount of unconstrained policymaking authority with a unitary elected executive promotes higher fiscal-spending growth. These effects systematically vary between Democratic and Republican governors. Specifically, fiscal-spending growth under Democratic governors reaches its apex when they possess either unilateral control over revenue forecasts or budget formulation, whereas, unilateral control over both policymaking tools yields the greatest fiscal-spending growth under Republican governors. This study underscores the benefits associated with constraining executive authority through shared policymaking authority arrangements in separation of powers systems.",One-way(Within),50*20,,,

Comparatively, these effects appear stronger in some countries than in others, but the three-country analysis only suggests reasons why.

Previous research on the electoral consequences of federal spending has focused almost exclusively on Congress, mostly with null results.

This relationship is stronger in battleground states. Furthermore, we show that federal grants are an electoral currency whose value depends on both the clarity of partisan responsibility for its provision and the characteristics of the recipients. Presidents enjoy increased support from spending in counties represented by co-partisan members of Congress. At the individual level, we also find that ideology conditions the response of constituents to spending; liberal and moderate voters reward presidents for federal spending at higher levels than conservatives.

Contrary to the conventional wisdom, I argue that institutions in some kinds of dictatorships allow regime insiders to hold leaders accountable for their foreign policy decisions. However, the preferences and perceptions of these autocratic domestic audiences vary, with domestic audiences in civilian regimes being more skeptical of using military force than the military officers who form the core constituency in military juntas. In personalist regimes in which there is no effective domestic audience, no predictable mechanism exists for restraining or removing overly belligerent leaders, and leaders tend to be selected for personal characteristics that make them more likely to use military force. I combine these arguments to generate a series of hypotheses about the conflict behavior of autocracies and test the hypotheses using new measures of authoritarian regime type. The findings indicate that, despite the conventional focus on differences between democracies and nondemocracies, substantial variation in conflict initiation occurs among authoritarian regimes. Moreover, civilian regimes with powerful elite audiences are no more belligerent overall than democracies.

We decompose two key economic aggregatesâ€”growth in real gross domestic product and unemploymentâ€”into their international and domestic components and demonstrate that voters hold incumbents more electorally accountable for the domestic than for the international component of growth. Voters in a wide variety of democracies benchmark national economic growth against that abroad, punishing (rewarding) incumbents for national outcomes that underperform (outperform) an international comparison. Tests suggest that this effect arises not from highly informed voters making direct comparisons but from ""pre-benchmarking"" by the media when reporting on the economy.

This analytical approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the influence that citizens' behavior has on congressional policy.
